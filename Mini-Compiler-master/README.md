# Mini-Compiler
A Compiler for subset of C To MIPS.

You will need lex, Yacc and SPIM emulator( to test MIPS code).

#Usage
make 
(this will generate an execuatble named start )

./start < example.c 
(this will generate mips code for example.c into mips_code.s)

#File Details
The files are not organized into folders but here is the short description of what happens in each files


cGrammer : Grammer used for this project

clexer.l : lexer file for defining valid language tokens

cparser.y : Yacc based parser. Checks for symmentic errors and generates Abstract SynTax Tree and outputs final MIPS code.

CtoMIPS.c : takes AST as input and generates MIPS code into mips_code.s

symbolTable.c : defines helping functions used for creating Symbol Table.

definition.c : helping functions for generating AST.

definition.h : defines structure for AST and Symbol Table. 

test.c : some test programs for testing.
